    <h2>Welcome to Cat Match!</h2>
    <p>Our Cat Match app will help you find the perfect cat breed for your home and lifestyle. Complete the survey questions below, and Cat Match will suggest compatable breeds for you based on the Cat API.</p>
    <p>Most of the attributes below are ranked on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the most. For example, if you have a dog, you might want to set the "dog friendly" filter to 5 for maximum dog-friendliness. If you have a small living space, you might want to set "Activity" to 1 or 2, so the app will show you less-active breeds.</p>
