# Cat-match by Junior Developer Group

## Introduction:

This is an app that lets you choose your perfect cat breed and uses api calls to the [The Cat Api](https://thecatapi.com/), to return breed information on cats.

## Technology and languages used:

This project is using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We are using axios for the api calls.

We are using dialog-polyfill to make sure the modal displays properly across browsers. If you don't have it already, please install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Open the project folder in your terminal and enter "npm install" to download the dialog-polyfill.
